# JuliaFractal
A simple Julia and Mandelbrot fractal renderer written in C++ using Qt

Note that this project was created as a challenge to write it in one day, so the code may not have great quality.

Left click on either fractal to move it, right click on the mandelbrot fractal to compute the corresponding julia fractal.
Zoom into either fractal with the mouse wheel.
